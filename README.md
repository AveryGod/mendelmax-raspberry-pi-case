Designed for using [octoprint](http://octoprint.org) with [my printer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/reefab/8843537904/) and keeping clutter to a minimum.

## Instructions

Uses M5 bolts with washers for the tabs (and t-nuts) and M3 bolts for the side bolts.

Before printing, check the options in the SCAD file if you want holes for GPIO
access or other choices.
